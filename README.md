# Dataset
Old dataset: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/mauricett/lichess_sf">HuggingFace dataset</a>.
Shitty format, will rework. It's curated Lichess data from 2023. New dataset will be 01.2023 - 05.2025 or so, and come in a different format. 

# FishBrain v0
I finished the first NN in 2024 and it worked okay. Now working on a more serious release, FishBrain v1. My old code is "research quality", a.k.a. it's not very usable, but at least it works... hey...

# Future directions?
Leela has produced enormous amount of data which is freely available. Would be cool to utilize this in the future, on top of the Stockfish data.
